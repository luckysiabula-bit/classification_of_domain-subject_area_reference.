### 1.1 Problem Statement

The rapid growth of digital content in education, research, and industry has made it increasingly difficult to organize and retrieve information effectively. Manual classification of documents into subject areas or domains is slow, costly, and prone to inconsistency due to human error. This creates barriers to efficient knowledge management and slows down research or learning processes. 

An automated classification system for domain/subject area reference will allow organizations to process large volumes of documents quickly, assign them to appropriate categories, and improve accessibility for end-users.

**1.2 Business Objectives**

The main business objective is to develop an automated classification system that assigns documents to predefined subject areas with high accuracy and efficiency. 

From a real-world perspective, success means:
- Reducing manual classification workload by at least 70%.
- Achieving a minimum classification accuracy of 80%.
- Improving document retrieval time in repositories and databases.
- Increasing user satisfaction by making content easier to find and navigate.
