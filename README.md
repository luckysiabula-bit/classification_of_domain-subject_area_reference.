## 1.2 Business Objectives

From a practical perspective, our objectives are to:

1. **Improve accessibility** — allow users to quickly identify the type of case without reading the entire judgment.
2. **Reduce search time** — enable legal researchers, students, and policymakers to find relevant cases faster.
3. **Support civic education** — make legal information more understandable and accessible to the public.
4. **Enhance knowledge management** — assist legal institutions in organizing and indexing judgments systematically.

**What "success" looks like in the real world:**

- A working system where a user can upload a PDF judgment and instantly get a predicted case type (e.g., _criminal_, _civil_, _constitutional_).
- High enough accuracy to be trusted in real-world legal research.
- A model that processes both text-based PDFs and scanned PDFs through OCR.
