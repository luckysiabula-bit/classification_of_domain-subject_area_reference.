### 1.1 Problem Statement

The rapid growth of digital content in education, research, and industry has made it increasingly difficult to organize and retrieve information effectively. Manual classification of documents into subject areas or domains is slow, costly, and prone to inconsistency due to human error. This creates barriers to efficient knowledge management and slows down research or learning processes. 

An automated classification system for domain/subject area reference will allow organizations to process large volumes of documents quickly, assign them to appropriate categories, and improve accessibility for end-users.
