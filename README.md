# 1. Business Understanding

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The rapid growth of digital content in education, research, and industry has made it increasingly difficult to organize and retrieve information effectively. Manual classification of documents into subject areas or domains is slow, costly, and prone to inconsistency due to human error. This creates barriers to efficient knowledge management and slows down research or learning processes. 

An automated classification system for domain/subject area reference will allow organizations to process large volumes of documents quickly, assign them to appropriate categories, and improve accessibility for end-users.

**1.2 Business Objectives**

The main business objective is to develop an automated classification system that assigns documents to predefined subject areas with high accuracy and efficiency. 

From a real-world perspective, success means:
- Reducing manual classification workload by at least 70%.
- Achieving a minimum classification accuracy of 80%.
- Improving document retrieval time in repositories and databases.
- Increasing user satisfaction by making content easier to find and navigate.


 ### 1.3 Data Mining Goals

To achieve the stated business objectives, the project will:
- Build a supervised classification model capable of predicting the correct subject area from textual input.
- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and word embeddings to extract meaningful features from text.
- Test multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and transformer-based models like BERT.
- Select the model that provides the best trade-off between accuracy, speed, and interpretability.

### 1.4 Initial Project Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if:
- The model achieves at least 80% accuracy on the test dataset.
- Precision and recall for each subject area are above 0.75.
- The system processes at least 500 documents per minute without significant performance loss.
- Classifications match expert-labeled results in at least 8 out of 10 randomly reviewed cases.
  
### 1.5 Section Integration

This section integrates all parts of the Business Understanding phase into a single, well-structured document. The text is organized into four main subsections: Problem Statement, Business Objectives, Data Mining Goals, and Initial Project Success Criteria. The same content is reflected in both the Google Colab notebook and the README.md file to ensure consistency between development and documentation. Formatting, headings, and numbering follow a clear and professional style for ease of reading.
